        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        
       
        <div class="image"><img class="mingyue" src="images/mingyue.jpg" alt="mingyue picture"></div>
    	<div class="text"><p style="margin-top: 100px; text-align: center; font-size: 60px;  ">I am a <br><strong>homeworker</strong>.</br></p></div>
       
         <div class="text"><p style="text-align:left;">I seldom go out for earning money or working. Relaxation and comfort mean a lot to me when it comes to work. As a homeworker, I have many options and actually have several jobs to do. Most of them are related to music and food. <a href="#"></a></p> </div>
        <p style="text-align:left;">You can call me a writer, a music composer, a gourmet, a traveller, and even more. I haven't figured out an exact way to define myself yet. I guess "a homeworker" works just well for now. Or you may now think me as a guitar teacher or a director of a music studio, Guitaroof. </p>
        <img class="sleep" src="images/sleep.jpg" alt="sleep picture">
        <p style="text-align:center;font-size: 63px;">I was born in <strong>Guangdong, China</strong>. </p>
        <p style="text-align:left;"> I was born in Guangdong, China. I grew up there and got my highschool diploma there. I then went to America for further study. </p>
        <p style="font-size: 63px; text-align:center;"">I graduated from <strong>Pratt, NY</strong>.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;"><br>After high school graduation, I came to America for bachelor and master study in the field of music. Five years ago, I graduated from Pratt, the Art Institute in Brooklyn, New York. I also have earned a master degree in food science. </p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 60px;">I set off for <br><strong>adventures in career</strong> .</br></p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">I had been exploring around for the last few years, changing my jobs for several times in the past few years. I enjoyed this kind of life style, always trying things new. But I also know that it is important to find something to stick with. Last year I finally settled down as, which I preferred to define myself as, a homeworker.</p>
        <p>I enjoy staying at home and keep myself away from offices or any outside workplaces. I prefer a quiet and comfortable workspace, especially where I can wear my pajamas. It is not that I do not like to go outside. Instead, I love hanging out for travel, for food, for meeting with friends, and for all other kinds of fun things. </p>

        <h2>What I Did</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center; font-size: 60px;">Things about <br><strong>art and food</strong>.</br></p>
        <p style="text-align:left;"><br>In the past few years, I have been in art museums as interior design advisor and tour guide. Later, I got hired by local food magazines and music magazines as well, writing articles, songs or comments, which are the kinds of things that I am still doing now. </p>
        <p style="text-align:center; font-size: 50px;"> My last occupation was at <br><strong>a TV program</strong>.</br></p>
        <p style="text-align:left;"><br>I used to work in a food TV program in New York as one of the producers. It was the year before last year and was a wonderful experience for sure. But it was in California and I preferred to get back New York at that time.  </p>
        <p style="text-align:center; font-size: 57px;"> <br><strong>A change.</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">I then decided to change my vocation after working for the program for one year. Beyond objective constraints, I wanted some more challenges, perhaps something new.</p>
        <p style="text-align:center; font-size: 57px;">The studio is <br><strong>growing<strong>.</br></p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">This studio is well-known among new music composers nowadays. It is landing on several other states as well, including Wisconsin, California, Ohio, North Carolina, Michigan and Florida.  </p>
        <p style="text-align:center; font-size: 57px;">Something I do<br>for the studio.</br></p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">As the director of the studio, I am always invited to write articles for or make comments on local music magazines and newspapers. We provide all kinds of services related to music.</p>
